The Odin Project - CSS Project Landing Page
Originally completed this project once around March 2022. 
Got busy with fostering and starting a new job.
Coding fell to the back burner.
I deleted my old repositories and original attempt at this.
I restarted The Odin Project and re-did this from scratch.
The CSS isn't the cleanest, but it does what I want it to do.
As I learn more, I will find ways to clean up my code.
